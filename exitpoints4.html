    The 4th edition of the Exit Points improvisation series! Featuring a wonderful lineup of improvisers. 2 ensembles each play a 35 -minute set. The last hour of the concert we re-arrange ourselves into new ensembles for 5-minute pieces, and during this time we include members from the audience. 
    Cost: Online tip jar during the show. Proceeds split evenly among performers and our technician.
